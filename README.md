# Kryptos

Kryptos is a sculpture located on the grounds of CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia. Installed in 1990 by artist James Sanborn, its 1800 characters contain encrypted messages, of which three have been solved. There is still a fourth section at the bottom consisting of 97 or 98 characters which remains uncracked.

## About

This repository is dedicated to exploring and understanding the enigmatic Kryptos sculpture and its encoded messages. The code implemented in this repository serves as an experimental implementation of cryptographic methods used in Python. It is designed to demonstrate and explore the concepts of encryption and decryption, inspired by the intriguing Kryptos sculpture's encrypted messages.
